# OMJava
OpenModelica Java Interface

To build, simply use the command `make` and then use the generated jar-file somewhere.

The existing jUnit tests have not been tested since refactoring this repository from
[OMCompiler](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMCompiler) due to the latest jUnit release 
4.12) not being compatible with Java 1.8, but should work with `make test`.
